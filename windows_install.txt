    use covconnect *enter*
    then
    db.createUser({user: "covconnectUser", pwd: "<mongodb_password>", roles: [{ role: "readWrite", db: "covconnect" }]})
    replace <mongodb_password> with your preference
    then press enter
5.) go to config.json in the backend folder, replace <mongodb_password> with what you typed in step4
